            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>My journey to code was long but certain. I started as an enthusiastic entrepreneur during college. My business in Colorado was fun but not sustainable so I quit my painting business early on. From entrepreneurship I started to work for wells fargo. Finances were always fascinating to me and during 7 years I built my way up from loan underwriter to ehm..hard to describe. Today I implement new software solutions for a credit union at long island. I work on software conversion projects, managing transitions with vendors, and and configure connectivity between new and existing systems utilizing vendor software APIs. While building my career I built a very strong passion for code and after work I started studying algorithms and the react framework. And frankly I spend too much time with code and my marriage is at risk. I am excited to land a new fresh career where I can bring my experiences and excitement. I am looking for a team of great thinkers and humans who would like to go for happy hour sometimes and talk about code. </p>
            <h3>What I can do</h3>
